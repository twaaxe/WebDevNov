// Start your backend server before coding the below code.
// You can use the json-server package to create a fake REST API server.
// json-server db.json --watch

// The function below is not working yet. Please help me to fix it.
// I want to delete all posts from the server using the delete http request.
// I have tried to use the deleteAllPosts function below but it is not working.
// Maybe i need to use the fetch api to send the delete request for each post while looping through the posts.

function deleteAllPosts(){
    fetch
    console.log('Deleting all posts...');
    // delete one by one

}
